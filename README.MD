# Synonym Replacement Algorithm

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

To isolate the project's dependencies, create a virtual environment in your project directory.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  
  ```bash
  .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
  ```

### Step 2: Install Requirements

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

To run the synonym replacement algorithm, execute the `app.py` file.

```bash
python app.py
```
